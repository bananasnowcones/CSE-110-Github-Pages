Hi my name is **Michael Yap**. I am a Christian and I go to *Redeemer's Grace Church*! I love Christ, and studying the Bible! One of my favorite bible verses is Romans 5:8 

"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (NASB)

I also love coding. I am still learning, but I love front end! 
Here's an example of a CSS snippet:
```
.example {
    font-size: 10px;
    color:#e22777;
}
    
```
